-------------------------------------------------------------------
# App Description:

PrepUp is a app that builds a proactive community for people whos common goal is to get their dream jobs. The essence of the community if to strive by helping each other get steps closer to landing their dream jobs than they were the day before. We work with a simple principle of helping others get better while getting better yourself.

In short, Our Community thoroughly prepares you for any job interview and unite you with your dream job when your perfectly ready!

# Why this solution:

Before now, job seekers do not have an organized community, one that does not just answer begineer and advanced questions but intentionally checkmates the progress of her users or community members. Job seekers are also the ones who have to sort through the internet in search of a fitting job opening and applying where possible. This community also solves that problem. We are building a hive where even recruiters can come and find proven candidate who have gone through a series of test and mock interviews set up by the PrepUp system and are obviously good for the desired role.

This is a kind of LinkedIn platform, but this time, the reverse is the case where the user advertise their expertice and employers can find competent candidate in minutes and few clicks.

# Solutions:

PrepUp provides a number of solution some of which have already been mentioned. Our prime feature is the ability to match users with interviewers [ other users with more experience] to undergo a MOCK interview.


# Meaning of Our Mock Interviews:

The mock interview comes as a measure to practically understand and recognize the candidates weak points and also prepare him/her for a proper interview session. The setting of our mock interviews are totally as proffessional as a profer and original interview sesssion, even the questions asked are totally real-life interview questions.

The candidate is interviewed, after which his/her result is publised on his or her profile page as well as areas of concentratios and study depending of her carrer path.
